Memory Protection Keys for Userspace (PKU aka PKEYs) is a CPU feature found on
future Intel CPUs and on PowerPC 5 and higher CPUs.

Memory Protection Keys provide a mechanism for enforcing page-based
protections, but without requiring modification of the page tables when an
application changes protection domains.

It works by dedicating bits in each page table entry to a "protection key".
There is also a user-accessible register with two separate bits for each
key.  Being a CPU register, the user-accessible register is inherently
thread-local, potentially giving each thread a different set of protections
from every other thread.

On Intel:

	Four previously bits are used the page table entry giving 16 possible keys.

	The user accessible register(PKRU) has a bit each per key to disable
	access and to disable write.

	The feature is only available in 64-bit mode, even though there is
	theoretically space in the PAE PTEs.  These permissions are enforced on
	data access only and have no effect on instruction fetches.

On PowerPC:

	Five bits in the page table entry are used giving 32 possible keys.
	This support is currently for Hash Page Table mode only.

	The user accessible register(AMR) has a bit each per key to disable
	read and write. Access disable can be achieved by disabling
	read and write.

	'mtspr 0xd, mem' reads the AMR register
	'mfspr mem, 0xd' writes into the AMR register.

	Execution can  be  disabled by allocating a key with execute-disabled
	permission. The execute-permissions on the key; however, cannot be
	changed through a user accessible register. Instead; a powerpc specific
	system call sys_pkey_modify() must be used. The CPU will not allow
	execution of instruction in pages that are associated with
	execute-disabled key.


=========================== Syscalls ===========================

There are 3 system calls which directly interact with pkeys:

	int pkey_alloc(unsigned long flags, unsigned long init_access_rights)
	int pkey_free(int pkey);
	int pkey_mprotect(unsigned long start, size_t len,
			  unsigned long prot, int pkey);

Before a pkey can be used, it must first be allocated with
pkey_alloc().  An application calls the WRPKRU/AMR instruction
directly in order to change access permissions to memory covered
with a key.  In this example WRPKRU/AMR is wrapped by a C function
called pkey_set().

	int real_prot = PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE;
	pkey = pkey_alloc(0, PKEY_DISABLE_WRITE);
	ptr = mmap(NULL, PAGE_SIZE, PROT_NONE, MAP_ANONYMOUS|MAP_PRIVATE, -1, 0);
	ret = pkey_mprotect(ptr, PAGE_SIZE, real_prot, pkey);
	... application runs here

Now, if the application needs to update the data at 'ptr', it can
gain access, do the update, then remove its write access:

	pkey_set(pkey, 0); // clear PKEY_DISABLE_WRITE
	*ptr = foo; // assign something
	pkey_set(pkey, PKEY_DISABLE_WRITE); // set PKEY_DISABLE_WRITE again

Now when it frees the memory, it will also free the pkey since it
is no longer in use:

	munmap(ptr, PAGE_SIZE);
	pkey_free(pkey);

(Note: pkey_set() is a wrapper for the RDPKRU,WRPKRU or AMR instructions.
 An example implementation can be found in
 tools/testing/selftests/vm/protection_keys.c)

=========================== Behavior =================================

The kernel attempts to make protection keys consistent with the
behavior of a plain mprotect().  For instance if you do this:

	mprotect(ptr, size, PROT_NONE);
	something(ptr);

you can expect the same effects with protection keys when doing this:

	pkey = pkey_alloc(0, PKEY_DISABLE_ACCESS);
	pkey_mprotect(ptr, size, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE, pkey);
	something(ptr);

That should be true whether something() is a direct access to 'ptr'
like:

	*ptr = foo;

or when the kernel does the access on the application's behalf like
with a read():

	read(fd, ptr, 1);

The kernel will send a SIGSEGV in both cases, but si_code will be set
to SEGV_PKERR when violating protection keys versus SEGV_ACCERR when
the plain mprotect() permissions are violated.

========================== sysfs Interface ==========================

Information about support of protection keys on the system can be
found in the /sys/kernel/mm/protection_keys directory, which
contains the following files:

- total_keys: Shows the number of keys supported by the hardware.
    Not all of those keys may be available for use by a process
    because the platform or operating system may reserve some keys
    for their own use.

- usable_keys: Shows the minimum number of keys guaranteed to be
    available for use by a process. In other words: total_keys minus
    the keys reserved by the platform or operating system. This
    number doesn't change to reflect keys that are already being
    used by the process reading the file.

    There may be one more key available than what is advertised in
    this file because the kernel may use one key for mprotect()
    calls setting up memory with execute-only permissions. This file
    assumes that this key is being used, but if it is not the
    process will have one more key it can use for other purposes.

- disable_access_supported: Tells whether the system supports keys
    which disallow reading from a given page (i.e., the
    PKEY_DISABLE_ACCESS flag is supported).

- disable_write_supported: Tells whether the system supports keys
    which disallow writing to a given page (i.e., the
    PKEY_DISABLE_WRITE flag is supported).

- disable_execute_supported: Tells whether the system supports keys
    which disallow code execution from a given page (i.e., the
    PKEY_DISABLE_EXECUTE flag is supported).

====================================================================
		Semantic differences

The following semantic differences exist between x86 and power.

a) powerpc (PowerPC8 onwards) *also* allows creation of a key with
   execute-disabled.
	The following is allowed
	pkey = pkey_alloc(0, PKEY_DISABLE_EXECUTE);

b) changes to the key permission bits from a signal handler do not
   persist on x86. The PKRU specific  fpregs  entry  need   to  be
   modified for it to persist.  On powerpc the key  permission can
   be  modified  by  programming  the AMR register from the signal
   handler. The changes persist across signal boundaries.
